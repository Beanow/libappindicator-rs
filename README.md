# libappindicator-rs

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/qdot/libappindicator-rs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/qdot/libappindicator-rs) [![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/libappindicator-rs.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/libappindicator-rs)

Rust safe bindings for the libappindicator library. libappindicator
provides cross-distribution/window system functions for creating
systray icons and menus.

libappindicator-rs uses types from
the [gtk-rs project](http://github.com/gtk-rs) for convenience. See
the examples directory for ideas on building rust applications that
use libappindicator.
